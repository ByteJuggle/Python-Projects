#QR Code Generator

The code generates a QR code with a custom color scheme and saves it as "Result.png". Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

1. Importing Libraries:

    (a)qrcode: A Python library used to generate QR codes.
    (b)PIL.Image: Used for handling images, although in this case, it's not directly used because qrcode internally handles image creation.
    
2. QR Code Configuration:

    (a)version=1: Specifies the size of the QR code (1 is the smallest).
    (b)error_correction=qrcode.constants.ERROR_CORRECT_H: Sets the error correction level to 'H', allowing the QR code to be readable even if up to 30% of the code is damaged.
    (c)box_size=10: Determines the size of each box (pixel) in the QR code.
    (d)border=4: Sets the width of the border around the QR code.

3. Adding Data:

    (a)qr.add_data("https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxqlhRr6XVeiGt9qY8_9hJA"): Adds the YouTube channel link to the QR code.

4. Finalizing the QR Code:

    (a)qr.make(fit=True): Ensures the entire data fits within the QR code.

5. Customizing Colors:

    (a)img=qr.make_image(fill_color="aqua",back_color="blue"): Sets the QR code color to aqua and the background color to blue.

6.Saving the Image:

(a)img.save("Result.png"): Saves the generated QR code as a PNG image named "Result.png".

After running the "main.py" code, it will create a QR code with the specified link and colors and save it as "Result.png" in the directory.
